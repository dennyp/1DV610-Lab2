| ImageManipulator - _The name of the class in the module._                                                                                       | **Class names** - The name of a class should be a noun.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| applyFilterGrayscale() - _Function that applies a grayscale to the image._                                                                      | **Don't be cute** - The name says what the function does. It applies a grayscale filter to the image, no more no less.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| changeBrightness(factor) - _Function that changes the brightness of the image by multiplying RGB-values._                                       | **Use intention-revealing names** - The method changes the brightness of the image. You could argue that you could add information about the factor in the name so it becomes changeBrightnessByFactor(factor). You would easier notice that you should enter a parameter for multiplication then. |
| changeTint(color, factor) - _Function that adds a tint to an image. You can choose between manipulating the tint of either red, green or blue._ | **Use problem domain names** - I chose to use tint in the function name because it is generally used when working with image processing.                                                                                                                                                           |
| changeRotation(degrees) - _Function that rotates the image by specified degrees._                                                               | **Use intention-revealing names** - Here I think i can change the name to rotateImageByDegrees(degrees) instead to make it more clear that it is the image you are rotating and nothing else. You would also notice that you should use degrees and not radians.                                   |
